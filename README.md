# Drone Hand Gesture Control &amp; Face tracking

## Overview:
Traditional methods of drone control, such as remote controllers and mobile
applications, require substantial manual input and expertise, limiting their
accessibility and usability for the usual individual. Not only that, but in some cases
carrying a remote controller on-set can be troublesome, for example filming while
standing in a pool of water, or when the remote controller is broken etc.
To solve that, we will design **Hand Gesture Control &amp; Face tracking control-based
modes to make drone controlling more user-friendly and intuitive.**   
Currently (almost) every individual has experienced using technology that takes touch as an input like a
keyboard or a smartphone, which means that basing such a complicated task of
drone controlling on hand gestures will be significantly easier to do in our age
compared to the previous years.

## Set up:
1. Clone the repo:  
    `git clone https://github.com/jinMori127/Hand-Drone-Control.git`
2. Install the required packages:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

**Note:** Our code works on tello drone, so to run it you need to have a drone that compatible with  
`djitellopy` library else you will need to change the commands that related to the drone movement.
